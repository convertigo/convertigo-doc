##### Defines a step able to list the entries of a directory. 

A <i>List directory</i> step lists all the non hidden files of the first level contained in the directory specified by the <b>Source directory</b> property.

Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Sort by | FileSortByPolicy | standard | Defines the way to sort file entries.<br/>Directory files may be sorted by name (default), size or last modified time.
Source directory | JS expression | standard | Defines the source directory path.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the path of the directory which content has to be listed. <br/>This path is either absolute or relative to Convertigo environment. Relative paths starting with:<br/><br/>• <span class="computer">./</span> are relative to Convertigo workspace,<br/>• <span class="computer">.//</span> are relative to current project folder. <br/>
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to <span class="computer">true</span> to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to <span class="computer">false</span> to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/>Setting this property to <span class="computer">false</span> does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
