##### Duplicates a file or a directory in the same path. 

The <i>Duplicate file</i> step duplicates a file or a directory in a given path updating its name.

Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Name of the copy | JS expression | expert | Defines the name of the duplicated object (file or directory).<br/>Duplicating in the same parent folder, the copied file or directory name must be updated. This name must be different from original file or directory name.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to <span class="computer">true</span> to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to <span class="computer">false</span> to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/>Setting this property to <span class="computer">false</span> does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
Overwrite | boolean | expert | If a file or folder with the same name as the <b>Name of the copy</b> property exists in current directory, this property defines whether to overwrite it.<br/>By default this property is set to <span class="computer">false</span>, so the previously existing file or folder will not be overwritten if already present in current directory.
Source | JS expression | expert | Defines the path of the file or directory to duplicate.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the path of the file or directory to duplicate. <br/>This path is either absolute or relative to Convertigo environment. Relative paths starting with:<br/><br/>• <span class="computer">./</span> are relative to Convertigo workspace,<br/>• <span class="computer">.//</span> are relative to current project folder. <br/>
