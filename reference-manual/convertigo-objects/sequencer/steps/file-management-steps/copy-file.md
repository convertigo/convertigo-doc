##### Copies a file or a directory to an another path.

The *Copy file* step duplicates a file or a directory from a path to another keeping the same name.

**Note:** **Source** parent folder and **Destination** folder cannot be the same.


Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Destination | JS expression | expert | Defines the destination directory path.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the path of the destination folder, that must be an existing folder. Otherwise, the copy will not be possible.<br/><br/>This path is either absolute or relative to Convertigo environment. Relative paths starting with:<br/><br/>- `./` are relative to Convertigo workspace,<br/>- `.//` are relative to current project folder.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to `true` to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to `false` to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/><br/>Setting this property to `false` does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
Overwrite | boolean | expert | If a file or folder with the same name exists in **Destination** directory, this property defines whether to overwrite it.<br/>By default this property is set to `false`, so the file or folder will not be overwritten if already present in **Destination** directory.
Source | JS expression | expert | Defines the path of the file or directory to copy.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the path of the file or directory to copy.<br/><br/>This path is either absolute or relative to Convertigo environment. Relative paths starting with:<br/><br/>- `./` are relative to Convertigo workspace,<br/>- `.//` are relative to current project folder.
