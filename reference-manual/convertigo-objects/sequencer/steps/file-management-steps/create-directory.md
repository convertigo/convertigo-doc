Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Create non existent parent directories | boolean | expert | Defines whether the non existent but necessary parent directories should be created or not.<br/>By default, this property is set to `true`: parents directories specified in path but not existing on disk are also created.<br/><br/>If set to `false`, the directory will be created only if all parent directories are existing.
Destination | JS expression | expert | Defines the destination path.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the path of the destination folder.<br/><br/>This path is either absolute or relative to Convertigo environment. Relative paths starting with:<br/><br/>- `./` are relative to Convertigo workspace,<br/>- `.//` are relative to current project folder.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to `true` to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to `false` to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/><br/>Setting this property to `false` does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
