##### Creates a JSON base type.

The *Field* step adds a JSON string, number, boolean or null.

The element resulting from this step can be output in the response of the sequence if the **Output** property is set to `true`, or used as a source by any other following step.

*Field* will be inserted to its *Object* parent using the **key** property as JSON key. Its value is set thanks to a source defined in **Source** property. If no source is defined or if its results is empty, the element contains the value of the **Default value** property, if a value is defined in this property.


Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Key | SmartType | standard | Defines the key name used for its Object parent owner.<br/>This property is a "smart type" property, that allows to specify the key.<br/><br/>A "smart type" property can be of one of the following types:<br/><br/>- a **text**: the value is therefore a hard-coded text value,<br/>- a **JavaScript expression**: the value is therefore a JavaScript expression that is evaluated at sequence execution,<br/>- a **source**: the value is a source and can be picked using the source picker. A **source** is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution.<br/><br/>**Note:**<br/><br/>- If you use the **source** type for this property, the XPath application on target XML should give a text result. Otherwise, the first node's text content is taken.
Type | JsonFieldType | standard | Defines the `type` for the value JSON transformation.<br/>This property defines `string` as default type.<br/><br/>This value can be updated. Possible type values are the following:<br/><br/>- `string`,<br/>- `number`,<br/>- `boolean`,<br/>- `null`.
Value | SmartType | standard | Defines the expression evaluated to give the text to output.<br/>This property is a "smart type" property, that allows to specify the key.<br/><br/>A "smart type" property can be of one of the following types:<br/><br/>- a **text**: the value is therefore a hard-coded text value,<br/>- a **JavaScript expression**: the value is therefore a JavaScript expression that is evaluated at sequence execution,<br/>- a **source**: the value is a source and can be picked using the source picker.

Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to `true` to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to `false` to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/><br/>Setting this property to `false` does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
