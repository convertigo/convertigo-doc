##### Sets a response status for the current sequence.

The *Set response status* step allows set an HTTP status on the sequence's response.

The status code and message are set using the **Status code** and the **Status text** properties.

**Note:** Although its **Output** property is set to `false` by default, this step generates an `status` XML Element in output, that contain the status code and text in child elements.


Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Status code | SmartType | standard | Defines the code value associated with the status.<br/>This property is a "smart type" property, that allows to define the HTTP status code to set on the response.<br/><br/>A "smart type" property can be of one of the following types:<br/><br/>- a **text**: the value is therefore a default text value,<br/>- a **JavaScript expression**: the value is therefore a JavaScript expression that is evaluated at sequence execution,<br/>- a **source**: the value is a source and can be picked using the source picker. A **source** is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution.
Status text | SmartType | standard | Defines the text message associated with the status.<br/>This property is a "smart type" property, that allows to define the HTTP status message to set on the response.<br/><br/>A "smart type" property can be of one of the following types:<br/><br/>- a **text**: the value is therefore a default text value,<br/>- a **JavaScript expression**: the value is therefore a JavaScript expression that is evaluated at sequence execution,<br/>- a **source**: the value is a source and can be picked using the source picker. A **source** is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to `true` to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to `false` to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/><br/>Setting this property to `false` does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
