##### Defines a step which removes a named Convertigo context.

The *Remove context* step removes a Convertigo context that was created by:

- a previous *Call Transaction* or *Call Sequence* step for which a specific context name was defined,
- an `__context` parameter sent to Convertigo while previously calling a transaction/sequence.

The name of the context to remove is specified through the **Context name** property.

**Note:** The creation or the destruction of a named context is effective in server mode only.


Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Context name | JS expression | expert | Defines the name of the context to remove.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated at sequence execution. The computed context name is appended to the current session `JSessionID` to define the context ID that is removed.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to `true` to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to `false` to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/><br/>Setting this property to `false` does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
