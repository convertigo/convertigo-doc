##### Generates a hash code from a given file.

The *Hash code* step generates a hash code from a given file using a predefined algorithm, that can be configured using the **Hash algorithm** property.


Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Hash algorithm | HashAlgorithm | standard | Defines the algorithm to use for file hashing.<br/>This property can take one of the following values:<br/><br/>- `MD5`: uses `MD5` algorithm to generate the hash from the file,<br/>- `SHA-1`: uses `SHA-1` algorithm to generate the hash from the file.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Node name | String | standard | Defines the tag name of the generated XML element.<br/>This property can contain any name, no words are reserved, and must follow the rules on XML naming:<br/><br/>- it can contain letters, numbers, and other characters,<br/>- it cannot start with a number,<br/>- it cannot contain spaces nor punctuation character.
Offset | JS expression | standard | Defines the offset in bytes from where the hash starts.<br/>This property allows you to hash just a part of your file. The offset must not be bigger than the file size.
Source | JS expression | standard | Defines the path of the file to hash.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the path of the file to hash.<br/><br/>This path is either absolute or relative to Convertigo environment. Relative paths starting with:<br/><br/>- `./` are relative to Convertigo workspace,<br/>- `.//` are relative to current project folder.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to `true` to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to `false` to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/><br/>Setting this property to `false` does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
