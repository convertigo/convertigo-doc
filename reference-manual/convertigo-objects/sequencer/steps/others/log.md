##### Produces output data in log file.

This step outputs a message in the Convertigo logger defined in the **Logger** property, for the log level defined in the **Level** property.

The message to output is generated from the JavaScript expression defined in **Expression** property.


Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Expression | JS expression | standard | Defines the expression evaluated to give the text to output.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the text string to output in log file.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Level | String | standard | Defines the `log level` on which the log applies.<br/>This property defines the minimum level of log for which the message has to be output. The message will be output for any log level superior or equals to this property value.<br/><br/>Log levels possible values are the following, by ascending order:<br/><br/>- `ERROR`,<br/>- `WARN`,<br/>- `INFO`,<br/>- `DEBUG`,<br/>- `TRACE`.
Logger | String | standard | Defines the `logger` on which the log applies.<br/>This property defines `Context` logger as default logger.<br/><br/>This value can be updated. Possible logger values are the following:<br/><br/>- `Engine`: the message will be seen as output by the Convertigo Engine,<br/>- `Context`: the message will be seen as output by the running Context,<br/>- `Context.User`: the message will be seen as output in the running Context, defined by the User,<br/>- `Context.Audit`: the message will be seen as output in the running Context, in a separate Audit logger.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to `true` to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to `false` to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/><br/>Setting this property to `false` does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
