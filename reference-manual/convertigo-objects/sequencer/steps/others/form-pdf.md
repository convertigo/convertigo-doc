##### *Generate a PDF with dynamic data in it.*

The ***PDF form step*** allows you to generate a PDF. You can use a tool such as PDFescape to make your PDF dynamic. You can use a complex containing elements to add dynamic values in your PDF. The elements names must be the name of your fields, then add its values.

The template file path can be either relative or absolute :

 • ./ are relative to Convertigo workspace.

 • .// are relative to current project folder.

 •  For absolute path you need to escape "\".

  Two actions are possible : *fillForm* and *getFields*.

 For the ***Fields*** property you can source your fields created with a complex type, or use a JSON Object type expression.

 If using a JSON Object type expression, this must be of the type : {key: value} where 'key' is your field name and 'value' its value.

If you want to insert images in the PDF. You must create in the template for each image placeholder a "Submit" Button field with the size and position you would like the image to be inserted. The Form Fill Step will automatically scale the image to the Size of the button.

The Image data can be in base64 format (Without the data:image/xxxx;base64, header) or can be a JPG or GIF file on disk. In this case just give the path to the image file.

**Action :**

 • *fillForm :* Fill the form fields with values. You can use either complex type with elements or JSON Object type expression.

 • *getFields :* Collect all the fields of your PDF template. Return a XML schema.
