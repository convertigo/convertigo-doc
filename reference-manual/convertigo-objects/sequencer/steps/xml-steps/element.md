##### Creates an XML element with a text content. 

The <i>Element</i> step adds an element node with text content to parent generated XML element in the sequence XML output. <br/>The XML element resulting from this step can be output in the response XML of the sequence if the <b>Output</b> property is set to <span class="computer">true</span>, or used as a source by any other following step.<br/>The element is named after the value of the <b>Node name</b> property, its value is set thanks to a source defined in <b>Source</b> property. If no source is defined or if its results is empty, the XML element contains the value of the <b>Default value</b> property, if a value is defined in this property. <br/><span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> <br/><br/>• Child steps can be added under this step to create a data structure.<br/>• In Convertigo Studio, when an <i>Element</i> step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by a <i>Concat</i> step, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option <b>Change to</b> &gt; <b>Concat</b>. The <b>Node name</b> property remains the same. The <b>Source</b> and <b>Default value</b> properties are moved to the <i>Concat</i> step as two lines of the list of source items to concat, one with a source defined and one with a default value defined.<br/>

Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Default value | String | standard | Defines the default text value of the element.<br/>This property allows defining a default value to use when no source is defined or when the source result is empty.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Node name | String | standard | Defines the tag name of the generated XML element.<br/>This property can contain any name, no words are reserved, and must follow the rules on XML naming:<br/><br/>• it can contain letters, numbers, and other characters, <br/>• it cannot start with a number, <br/>• it cannot contain spaces nor punctuation character.<br/>
Assigned XSD Complex type QName  | XmlQName | expert | Defines a global schema Complex type to assign as a type to this structured XML element.<br/>This property allows to assign an XSD Complex type to the structured XML element generated by this step. <br/>The QName defined by this property can be: <br/><br/>• a new Complex type name: the Complex type will be created from this structure in the project's schema, <br/>• an already defined Complex type name: the existing Complex type is used and possibly enhanced by the structure generated by this XML element (if not identical): the Complex type will be a union of all XML structures using it.<br/><br/>To use an already existing Complex type name, the popup editor displays all types available in the project's schema: <br/><br/>• in grey: all non editable schema types (Convertigo standard error schema, types imported through references, types of transactions, etc.), <br/>• in blue: all schema types dynamically generated from the project's sequences, <br/>• in green: all dynamic schema types explicitly named by <b>Assigned XSD Complex type QName </b> or <b>Assigned XSD Element ref QName</b> properties.<br/>
Assigned XSD Element ref QName | XmlQName | expert | Defines a global schema Element to assign as a reference to this structured XML element.<br/>This property allows to assign a referenced Element to the structured XML element generated by this step. The referenced Element and its corresponding XSD Complex type will also be created if non existing in the project's schema. <br/>The QName defined by this property can be: <br/><br/>• a new referenced Element name: the referenced Element and the corresponding Complex type will be created from this structure in the project's schema, <br/>• an already defined referenced Element name: the existing referenced Element is used and its Complex type is possibly enhanced by the structure generated by this XML element (if not identical): the Complex type will be a union of all XML structures using it.<br/><br/>To use an already existing referenced Element name, the popup editor displays all types available in the project's schema: <br/><br/>• in grey: all non editable schema types (Convertigo standard error schema, types imported through references, types of transactions, etc.), <br/>• in blue: all schema types dynamically generated from the project's sequences, <br/>• in green: all dynamic schema types explicitly named by <b>Assigned XSD Complex type QName </b> or <b>Assigned XSD Element ref QName</b> properties.<br/>
Assigned XSD Simple type QName | XmlQName | expert | Defines the schema base type to assign as a type to this simple XML element.<br/>This property allows to assign a simple XSD type to the simple XML element generated by this step. It can only be used when the step actually generates a simple XML element.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to <span class="computer">true</span> to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to <span class="computer">false</span> to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/>Setting this property to <span class="computer">false</span> does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
Source | XMLVector | expert | Defines the source to use as value.<br/>This property allows defining a node or a list of nodes from a previous step on which current step works. <br/>A <b>source</b> is defined as a reference on a step previously existing in the parent sequence, associated with an XPath applied on the step's result DOM. At runtime, the XPath is applied on the step's current execution result XML and extracts a list of XML nodes resulting from this execution. <br/>If the XPath doesn't match or if the source is left blank, the step uses the value defined in <b>Default value</b> property, if a value is defined in this property. Otherwise, the step creates an element with no data.
