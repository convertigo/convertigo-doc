##### Creates a list of XML elements containing dates based on input definitions.

*Generate dates* step is used to generate a list of dates. These dates are generated based upon **Input** properties.

Depending on **Split** property value, resulting dates can be:

- formatted, thanks to **Output** properties, into text in XML elements that are inserted in the sequence's XML output,
- split in several pieces of information (day of week, day date, month, year) that are added into an XML structure inserted in the sequence's XML output.


Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Node name | String | standard | Defines the tag name of the generated XML element.<br/>This property can contain any name, no words are reserved, and must follow the rules on XML naming:<br/><br/>- it can contain letters, numbers, and other characters,<br/>- it cannot start with a number,<br/>- it cannot contain spaces nor punctuation character.
Assigned XSD Simple type QName | XmlQName | expert | Defines the schema base type to assign as a type to this simple XML element.<br/>This property allows to assign a simple XSD type to the simple XML element generated by this step. It can only be used when the step actually generates a simple XML element.
Input - Days of week | XMLVector | expert | Defines the days of week.<br/>This property defines the days of the week which dates have to be generated. Days of week are defined by numbers which can take different values depending on the **Java Calendar compatibility** property:<br/><br/>- for Java Calendar compatible format - M:2, T:3, W:4, T:5, F:6, S:7, S:1;<br/>- for classic format - M:1, T:2, W:3, T:4, F:5, S:6, S:7.<br/><br/>**Note:**<br/><br/>- For generating several days, separate days numbers by a comma (`","`). For example: `"2,3,4,5,6,7,1"` to generate all days with **Java Calendar compatibility** property to `true`.<br/>- The order of defined days numbers does not impact the dates generation. For example: `"2,3,4,5,6,7,1"` and `"5,2,6,4,3,7,1"` values give the same output result dates.
Input - End date | XMLVector | expert | Defines the end date using **Input - format** property value format.<br/>This property defines the date to which dates are generated (day included).
Input - Format | String | expert | Defines the input dates format.<br/>Input dates text must be formatted depending on this property.<br/><br/>For example, if dates are entered in the following form: `09/09/2009`, the **Input - Format** property can be set to:<br/><br/>- `MM/dd/yyyy`, with the **Input - Locale** property set to `US`,<br/>- `dd/MM/yyyy`, with the **Input - Locale** property set to `FR`.<br/><br/>For more information on usable symbols, see Appendix "*Date format - Usable symbols*".
Input - Locale | String | expert | Defines the input dates locale.<br/>Input dates text must be formatted depending on this property.<br/><br/>For example, with the **Input - Format** property set to `dd MMMM yyyy`, the **Input - Locale** property can be set to:<br/><br/>- `US`, if entered dates look like `09 September 2009`,<br/>- `FR`, if entered dates look like `09 septembre 2009`.
Input - Start date | XMLVector | expert | Defines the start date using **Input - format** property value format.<br/>This property defines the date from which dates are generated (day included).
Java Calendar compatibility | boolean | expert | Defines whether input/output properties values are compatible with the `Java Calendar`.<br/>If this property is set to `false`, the input/output properties values use traditional calendar notations:<br/><br/>- weekdays go from 1 to 7,<br/>- months go from 01 to 12,<br/>- days go from 01 to 31.<br/><br/>If this property is set to `true`, the input/output properties values use Java Calendar notations:<br/><br/>- weekdays go from 1 to 7 (but order differs from traditional calendar, see the **Input - Days of week** property),<br/>- months go from 0 to 11,<br/>- days go from 1 to 31.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to `true` to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to `false` to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/><br/>Setting this property to `false` does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
Output - Format | String | expert | Defines the dates output format in "`no split`" case.<br/>This property defines the resulting date format when dates are generated as texts (see **Split** property description).<br/><br/>In this case, text of generated dates is formatted depending on **Output - Format** property.<br/><br/>For example, if the **Output - Format** property is set to `yyyy MM dd`, the `09/09/2009` resulting date would be written: `2009 09 09`.<br/><br/>For more information on usable symbols, see Appendix "*Date format - Usable symbols*".
Output - Locale | String | expert | Defines the dates output locale in "`no split`" case.<br/>This property defines the resulting date locale when dates are generated as texts. Text is formatted depending on this property.<br/><br/>For example, if the date is `09/09/2009` and the resulting **Output - Format** property is set to `MMMM`, the resulting date would be written:<br/><br/>- "September", with the **Output - Locale** property set to `US`,<br/>- "septembre", with the **Output - Locale** property set to `FR`.
Split | boolean | expert | Defines whether dates should be split into several pieces of data or written as text.<br/>If this property is set to `false` (i.e. "`no split`" format), each generated date is created with the following format:<br/><br/>`<date>date into `**Output format**` format</date>`.If this property is set to `true` (i.e. "`split`" format), each generated date is created with the following format:<br/><br/>`<date>``    <dayOfWeek>value of dayOfWeek</dayOfWeek>``    <day>value of day</day>``    <month>value of month</month>``    <year>value of year/year>``</date>`
