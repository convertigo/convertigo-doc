##### Defines an empty XML element (with no text content). 

The <i>Complex</i> step generates an output XML tag and can contain other steps generating XML (for example: <i>Element</i>, <i>Attribute</i> or <i>Complex</i> steps) in order to create any XML structure.<br/>This structure can be output in the response XML of the sequence if the <b>Output</b> property is set to <span class="computer">true</span>, or used as a source by any other following step.<br/><span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> Child steps have to be added under this step to create a data structure.

Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Node name | String | standard | Defines the tag name of the generated XML element.<br/>This property can contain any name, no words are reserved, and must follow the rules on XML naming:<br/><br/>• it can contain letters, numbers, and other characters, <br/>• it cannot start with a number, <br/>• it cannot contain spaces nor punctuation character.<br/>
Assigned XSD Complex type QName  | XmlQName | expert | Defines a global schema Complex type to assign as a type to this structured XML element.<br/>This property allows to assign an XSD Complex type to the structured XML element generated by this step. <br/>The QName defined by this property can be: <br/><br/>• a new Complex type name: the Complex type will be created from this structure in the project's schema, <br/>• an already defined Complex type name: the existing Complex type is used and possibly enhanced by the structure generated by this XML element (if not identical): the Complex type will be a union of all XML structures using it.<br/><br/>To use an already existing Complex type name, the popup editor displays all types available in the project's schema: <br/><br/>• in grey: all non editable schema types (Convertigo standard error schema, types imported through references, types of transactions, etc.), <br/>• in blue: all schema types dynamically generated from the project's sequences, <br/>• in green: all dynamic schema types explicitly named by <b>Assigned XSD Complex type QName </b> or <b>Assigned XSD Element ref QName</b> properties.<br/>
Assigned XSD Element ref QName | XmlQName | expert | Defines a global schema Element to assign as a reference to this structured XML element.<br/>This property allows to assign a referenced Element to the structured XML element generated by this step. The referenced Element and its corresponding XSD Complex type will also be created if non existing in the project's schema. <br/>The QName defined by this property can be: <br/><br/>• a new referenced Element name: the referenced Element and the corresponding Complex type will be created from this structure in the project's schema, <br/>• an already defined referenced Element name: the existing referenced Element is used and its Complex type is possibly enhanced by the structure generated by this XML element (if not identical): the Complex type will be a union of all XML structures using it.<br/><br/>To use an already existing referenced Element name, the popup editor displays all types available in the project's schema: <br/><br/>• in grey: all non editable schema types (Convertigo standard error schema, types imported through references, types of transactions, etc.), <br/>• in blue: all schema types dynamically generated from the project's sequences, <br/>• in green: all dynamic schema types explicitly named by <b>Assigned XSD Complex type QName </b> or <b>Assigned XSD Element ref QName</b> properties.<br/>
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to <span class="computer">true</span> to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to <span class="computer">false</span> to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/>Setting this property to <span class="computer">false</span> does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
