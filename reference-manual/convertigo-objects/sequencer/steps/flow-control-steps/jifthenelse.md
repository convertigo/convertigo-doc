##### Defines an `IF...THEN...ELSE...` conditional step based on a JavaScript condition.

The *jIfThenElse* step is one of the Convertigo Sequencer conditional steps. This step is based on a JavaScript condition and contains two child steps (*Then* and *Else*) which are executed depending on the condition fulfillment:

- `Then` step and child steps are executed when the condition is verified,
- `Else` step and child steps are executed when the condition is not verified.

The condition, defined in the **Condition** property, is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution as `true` or `false`.

**Note:** In Convertigo Studio, when an *jIfThenElse* step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by an *jIf*, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option **Change to** > **jIf**. The **Condition** property remains the same and the steps present in the sub-steps are:

- steps present in the *Then* step are moved to the *jIf*,
- steps present in the *Else* step are deleted.


Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Condition | JS expression | standard | Defines the block condition expression.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that will be evaluated as condition (`true` or `false`) in order to decide whether to execute or not the child steps.<br/><br/>JavaScript variables and code are supported in this property.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to `true` to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to `false` to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/><br/>Setting this property to `false` does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
