##### Defines an `IF` conditional step looking for the existence of a file or a directory.

The *IfFileExists* step is one of Convertigo Sequencer conditional steps. This step contains other steps executed only if the file or directory defined through the **Source** property exists.

**Note:** In Convertigo Studio, when an *IfFileExists* step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by an *IfFileExistsThenElse*, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option **Change to** > **IfFileExistsThenElse**. The **Source** property remains the same and the steps present in the *IfFileExists* are moved to the *Then* sub-step.


Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Source | JS expression | standard | Defines the path of the file or directory which existence has to be checked.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives the path of the file or directory which existence has to be checked.<br/><br/>This path is either absolute or relative to Convertigo environment. Relative paths starting with:<br/><br/>- `./` are relative to Convertigo workspace,<br/>- `.//` are relative to current project folder.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to `true` to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to `false` to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/><br/>Setting this property to `false` does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
