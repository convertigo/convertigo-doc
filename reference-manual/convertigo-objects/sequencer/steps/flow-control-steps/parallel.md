##### Defines a step executing child steps in parallel.

A *Parallel* step executes steps simultaneously in parallel contexts. The maximum number of contexts is set by the value of the **Max. threads** property.

Each child step is executed in a dedicated thread. When a child thread is completed, all of its resources are released. As a consequence, a step defined outside a *Parallel* step cannot source any information from it.

To do so, it is recommended that you:

- create a *Complex* step as a parent of the *Parallel* step,
- generate information from the *Parallel* step into the *Complex* step,
- use the *Complex* step as a source outside the *Parallel* step.

A *Parallel* step is completed (i.e. the sequence will continue flow execution) when all child threads have been completed. This means the step following a *Parallel* step starts right after all child threads have been completed.

Convertigo contexts are created for each child step executed in parallel. These contexts are automatically named after parent *Parallel* step properties.

If *Call transaction* or *Call sequence* steps are child of a *Parallel* step, contexts can be named after their **Context** property or automatically if this property is not specified.

Every automatically named context will be deleted after the *Parallel* step execution is completed. Explicitly named contexts will remain for further transaction or sequence use.


Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Max. threads | JS expression | standard | Defines the maximum number of simultaneously processed threads.<br/>If this number is inferior to the number of child steps to be executed simultaneously, all child steps cannot start. In this case, **Max. thread** child steps start executing. The others wait for threads to be available.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to `true` to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to `false` to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/><br/>Setting this property to `false` does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
