##### Defines a `DO...WHILE` loop step based on a JavaScript condition.

This step executes a group of child steps once, then repeats execution of the loop until the condition expression set in the **Condition** property is found to be false.

**Note:** You can add other steps to this step: these are the steps executed in the loop.

Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Condition | JS expression | standard | Defines the block condition expression.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that will be evaluated as condition (`true` or `false`) in order to decide whether to execute or not the child steps.<br/><br/>JavaScript variables and code are supported in this property.
