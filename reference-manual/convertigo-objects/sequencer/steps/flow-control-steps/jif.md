##### Defines an `IF` conditional step based on a JavaScript condition.

The *jIf* step is one of Convertigo Sequencer conditional steps. This step is based on a JavaScript condition and contains other steps executed only if the condition is fulfilled.

The condition, defined in the **Condition** property, is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution as `true` or `false`. If the condition is considered `true`, then steps under the parent *jIf* step are executed. If the condition is considered `false`, the steps under the parent *jIf* step are not executed.

**Note:** In Convertigo Studio, when an *jIf* step is created in a sequence, it can be easily replaced by an *jIfThenElse*, using the right-click menu on the step and choosing the option **Change to** > **jIfThenElse**. The **Condition** property remains the same and the steps present in the *jIf* are moved to the *Then* sub-step.


Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Condition | JS expression | standard | Defines the block condition expression.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that will be evaluated as condition (`true` or `false`) in order to decide whether to execute or not the child steps.<br/><br/>JavaScript variables and code are supported in this property.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to `true` to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to `false` to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/><br/>Setting this property to `false` does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
