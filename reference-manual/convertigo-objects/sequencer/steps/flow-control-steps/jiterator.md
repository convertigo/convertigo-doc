##### Defines a loop step iterating on list items result from a JavaScript expression.

Also called *For Each* step, the *jIterator* step:

- defines a JavaScript expression as input list to work on, i.e. the name of a multi-valued variable, the name of a defined JavaScript Array, or the name of a NodeList variable created by a previous *jSource* step, etc.,
- iterates on each item of the specified input list,
- contains child steps that are executed on each iteration, as other loop steps (for example see "*Iterator*", "*jWhile*" and "*jDoWhile*" steps documentation and examples).

In the iteration, child steps can access and use:

- the current iterated item through a JavaScript variable named `item`, which type depends on the iterated Array or NodeList,
- the current iteration index through a JavaScript variable named `index`, which is an integer.


Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Expression | JS expression | standard | Defines the expression evaluated to give the list to iterate on.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution and gives a list of items (JavaScript `Array` or `NodeList`).<br/><br/>If the expression doesn't output a list object or if the expression is left blank, the step has no data to work on: the loop does not execute its child steps and the parent sequence execution continues
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Starting index | JS expression | standard | Defines the index from which the *jIterator* should start to iterate.<br/>In the case you do not want to start an iteration at the first item (index `0`), you can specify a starting index in this property.<br/><br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the sequence execution. By default, it is set to `0` for starting at the first item of the input list.<br/><br/>If the defined starting index does not exist in the input list, the loop does not execute its child steps and the parent sequence execution continues.
Stopping index | JS expression | standard | Defines the exclusive index to which the *Iterator* should stop to iterate.<br/>Intended mostly for testing purposes, this (optional) parameter limits the number of times the iterator loops if this last index is reached.<br/><br/>By default, it is not filled, so the *jIterator* loops on each item from the list.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to `true` to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to `false` to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/><br/>Setting this property to `false` does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
