##### Defines a step executing child steps in series.

All child steps of a *Serial* step are executed one after another, it is similar to the basic behavior of step execution when they are positioned just under the parent *Generic Sequence*.

A *Serial* step is completed (i.e. the sequence will continue flow execution) when all child steps have been completed. This means the step following a *Serial* step starts right after the last child step is completed.

Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to `true` to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to `false` to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/><br/>Setting this property to `false` does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
