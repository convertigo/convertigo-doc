##### Raises a Convertigo Engine exception.

In some circumstances, it is necessary to explicitly raise a Convertigo Engine exception. This is reflected as a `SoapFaultException` for SOAP web service callers or by an error structure in XML output for any other caller.

**Message** and **Details** properties can be set to complex JavaScript expressions, mixing text strings and data from variables. These expressions are evaluated during the sequence execution and build a dynamic message and details output in the raised exception.

The error XML structure contains a `type` attribute, which value is automatically set to `c8o` in case of Exception. It allows to differentiate an irrecoverable Server error from a project/applicative error created using an *Error* step (`type` attribute value is then `project`).

A *jException* step breaks the sequence execution flow, the sequence ends just after this step's execution (contrary to *Error* step which does not break the execution flow).


Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Details | JS expression | standard | Provides additional details about the triggered error.<br/>This property allows the developer to dynamically add some details content in the raised Exception, depending on the sequence execution.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the step is active.
Message | JS expression | standard | Provides the (humanly readable) error message.<br/>This property allows the developer to dynamically define the message text of the raised Exception, depending on the sequence execution.
Output | boolean | expert | Defines whether the XML generated by this step should be appended to the resulting XML.<br/>Set this property to `true` to add the step's resulting XML to the sequence's output XML (default value for steps generating XML). Set this property to `false` to prevent the steps's XML result to appear in the sequence's output XML.<br/><br/>Setting this property to `false` does not prevent the step's generated XML from being used as a source by other steps.
