##### Removes the authenticated user ID from the context/session.

The *Remove authenticated user* step allows to remove the authenticated user ID from the context/session. The context/session is not authenticated anymore.

**Note:** Although its **Output** property is set to `false` by default, this step generates an `authenticatedUserID` XML Element in output, that should always be empty if the step succeeds.
