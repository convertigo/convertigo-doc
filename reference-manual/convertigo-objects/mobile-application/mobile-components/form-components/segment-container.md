ion-segment<br/>

##### Defines a <i>Segment Container</i> component.<br/>
A Segment is a group of buttons, sometimes known as segmented controls, that allow the user to interact with a compact group of a number of controls.<br/>
Segments provide functionality similar to tabs, selecting one will unselect all others.<br/>
Like any other form's inputs, it has a <i>Control name</i> property you may change for a more friendly name to use in a <i>CustomValidator</i>.<br/>
