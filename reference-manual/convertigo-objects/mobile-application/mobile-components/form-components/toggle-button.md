ion-toggle<br/>

##### Defines a <i>Toggle Button</i> component.<br/>
This component is technically the same thing as an HTML checkbox input, except it looks different and is easier to use on a touch device. Toggles can also have colors assigned to them, by adding any color attribute.<br/>
Like any other form's inputs, it has a <i>Control name</i> property you may change for a more friendly name to use in a <i>CustomValidator</i>.<br/>

<br/>
<strong><u>Note:</u></strong> Make sure to add your component under a <i>Generic Item</i> or <code>&lt;ion-item&gt;</code> to make it work properly in form.
