Fixed | Use fixed to place a label to the left of the input element. The label does not hide when text is entered. The input will align on the same position, regardless of the length of the label. Placeholder text can be used in conjunction with a fixed label.
Floating | Floating labels are labels that animate or 'float' up when the input is selected. Add the floating attribute to an ion-label to use.
Range Left | Labels can be placed on either side of the range by adding the range-left or range-right property to the element. The element doesn't have to be an ion-label, it can be added to any element to place it to the left or right of the range.
Range Right | Labels can be placed on either side of the range by adding the range-left or range-right property to the element. The element doesn't have to be an ion-label, it can be added to any element to place it to the left or right of the range.
Stacked | A stacked label will always appear on top of the input. Add the stacked attribute to an ion-label to use. Placeholder text can be used in conjunction with an stacked label.
Comment | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.  This property generally contains an explanation about the object. 
Identifier | Defines the component identifier.  
Is active | Defines whether the component is active.
