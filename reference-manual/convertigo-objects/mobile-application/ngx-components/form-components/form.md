As the standard HTML <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> this component is used to collect user inputs, but it acts as a reactive form based on the Angular 2â€™s form library.<br/>
<span class="orangetwinsoft"><u>Note:</u></span> Every form's inputs such as <i>Text Input</i>, <i>Select Option</i>, <i>Toggle Button</i>,... should be added under a <i>Generic Item</i> to work properly in form.<br/>
