##### Defines a <i>Virtual Scroll Viewport</i> component.<br/>
This component helps displaying large lists of elements performantly by only rendering the items that fit on-screen.<br/>
Loading hundreds of elements can be slow in any browser; virtual scrolling enables a performant way to simulate all items being rendered by making the height of the container element the same as the height of total number of elements to be rendered, and then only rendering the items in view.<br/>
Virtual scrolling is different from strategies like infinite scroll where it renders a set amount of elements and then when you hit the end renders the rest.<br/>
This component works with the <i>CdkVirtualFor</i> Directive to specify scrollable items to render.<br/>
