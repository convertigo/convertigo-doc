They can be added to any action. However, they are mostly used by the <i>CallSequence</i>, <i>CallFullSync</i>, and <i>CustomAction</i> components.
Within a <i>CustomAction</i>, the value of a <i>Variable</i> can be accessed using the following expression: <code>vars.myVar</code> where <code>myVar</code> is a named <i>Variable</i>.
