##### Defines a <i>Post Data</i> action component. <br/>

 This component helps writing (post) data to a FullSync database.<br/>
You can add <i>Variable</i> components to this action.<br/>
<br/>
Each <i>Variable</i>'s name will be used as a jSON key with the variable value associated.<br/>
Also, if used in a form <code>submit</code> <i>Event</i>, all form inputs values will be automatically posted as key/value pairs, the key being the form control name and the value the current value of the input field.<br/>
<br/>
You can use the <i>root key</i> property to place the posted data in a wrapper object.<br/>
