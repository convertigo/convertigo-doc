ion-toggle
##### Defines a <i>Toggle Button</i> component.
This component is technically the same thing as an HTML checkbox input, except it looks different and is easier to use on a touch device. Toggles can also have colors assigned to them, by adding any color attribute.
Like any other form's inputs, it has a <i>Control name</i> property you may change for a more friendly name to use in a <i>CustomValidator</i>.
 For more information: <a href='https://ionicframework.com/docs/v3/components/#toggle' target='_blank'>Toggle</a>.

<span class='orangetwinsoft'><u>Note:</u></span> Make sure to add your component under a <i>Generic Item</i> or <code>&lt;ion-item&gt;</code> to make it work properly in form.
