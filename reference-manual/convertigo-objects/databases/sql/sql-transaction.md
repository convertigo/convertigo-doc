##### Defines an SQL transaction. 

An <i>SQL transaction</i> allows Convertigo to execute a request on an SQL database, which is accessed by the parent <i>SQL connector</i>. <br/>An <i>SQL transaction</i> is always associated with an SQL query, or several SQL queries, defined in the <b>Query</b> property. The query/queries can be dynamically configured using the transaction's variables (see <b>Query</b> property description and <i>Variable</i> objects documentation). <br/>The resultset is output in transaction's XML response in an <span class="computer">sql_output</span> element. The data organization in the <span class="computer">sql_output</span> element depends on the <b>Output mode</b> property. <br/>In case of multiple queries, the several queries are sequentially executed, using auto-commit mode defined in <b>Auto-commit</b> property. Each query's resultset is output in transaction's XML response in <span class="computer">sql_output</span> elements. The data organization in <span class="computer">sql_output</span> elements depends on the <b>Output mode</b> property and is the same for all queries of the transaction.

Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Accessibility | Accessibility | standard | Defines the transaction/sequence accessibility.<br/>This property can take the following values: <br/><br/>• <span class="computer">Public</span>: The transaction/sequence is runnable from everyone and everywhere, visible in the Test Platform and is also exposed in the SOAP WSDL as a web service method. <br/>• <span class="computer">Hidden</span>: The transaction/sequence is runnable but only from people who know the execution URL, not visible in the Test Platform nor exposed in the SOAP WSDL. <br/>• <span class="computer">Private</span>: The transaction/sequence is only runnable from within the Convertigo engine (<i>Call Transaction</i>/(<i>Call Sequence</i> steps), is not visible in the Test Platform and cannot be requested as SOAP web service method. This value is used for tests, unfinished transactions/sequences or functionalities not to be exposed. Private transactions/sequences remain runnable in the Studio, for the developer to be able to test its developments.<br/><br/><span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> In the Test Platform: <br/><br/>• The administrator user (authenticated in Administration Console or Test Platform) can see and run all transactions / sequences, no matter what their <b>accessibility</b> is. <br/>• The test user (authenticated in the Test Platform or in case of anonymous access) can see and run public transactions/sequences and run hidden ones if he knows their execution URL. <br/>
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Default XML column tag name | String | standard | Defines the default column tag name to output in XML response, depending on the <b>Output mode</b> property.<br/>This property allows to configure a tag name for each column of result, depending on the <b>Output mode</b> property. <br/>Default value is <span class="computer">column</span>.
Default XML row tag name | String | standard | Defines the default row tag name to output in XML response, depending on the <b>Output mode</b> property.<br/>This property allows to configure a tag name for each line of result, depending on the <b>Output mode</b> property. <br/>Default value is <span class="computer">row</span>.
Query | String | standard | Defines the SQL query/queries to execute on the target database.<br/>The <b>Query</b> property allows to define an SQL query or several SQL queries to be executed on the target database. Any SQL query must be written in accordance with the target database tables and available functions and keywords (depending on the parent <i>SQL connector</i> configuration). <br/>The SQL query/queries can be parameterized with the transaction's variables, to be dynamically configured at runtime with variable values. To use a transaction variable in an SQL query, use one of the following syntaxes in the query: <br/><br/>• <span class="computer">{variable_name}</span>: the simple-brace notation - variable name surrounded by curly braces - protects the SQL query from SQL injections, i.e. only the first value represented by the variable is used, discarding any further content (SQL injection). It works so that the variable only contains a value. This notation can only be used inside the <span class="computer">WHERE</span> clause. If you need to use a variable anywhere else inside the SQL query, you should use the double-brace notation. <br/>• <span class="computer">{{variable_name}}</span>: the double-brace notation - variable name surrounded by double curly braces - does not protect the SQL query from SQL injections, i.e. the variable content can contain any content. If the variable value contains a piece of SQL query, it will not prevent the SQL query execution. This may be useful when a whole <span class="computer">WHERE</span> clause is computed outside the transaction (at sequence level for example) and passed as a variable to the SQL transaction. It should also be used when variables need to be used in the query outside of the <span class="computer">WHERE</span> clause. <br/><br/>In the case of multiple SQL queries, they must be separated by semicolons ';'. <br/><span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> <br/><br/>• In the case of multiple SQL queries, you cannot use the <b>Optional max number of results</b> property in this case. <br/>
Response timeout | long | standard | Defines the response maximum waiting time (in seconds).<br/>Maximum time (in seconds) for a transaction/sequence to run. When specified time is reached, the transaction/sequence ends and returns a timeout error. If requested through the SOAP interface, the error is returned as a SOAP exception.
Add statistics to response | boolean | expert | Defines whether some statistics of execution of the transaction/sequence should be added as data in the transaction/sequence's response.<br/>If this property is set to <span class="computer">true</span>, the transaction/sequence response will be enhanced with the statistics data of its execution (total time for the request, time spent waiting for the mainframe, etc.). <br/><span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> This property has nothing to do with the general property of the Convertigo engine <b>Insert statistics in the generated document</b> that can be edited in the <i>Configuration</i> page of the <i>Administration Console</i>.
Authenticated context required | boolean | expert | Defines whether an authenticated context is required to execute the transaction/sequence.<br/>If this property is set to <span class="computer">true</span>, the context of execution of the transaction/sequence must have been authenticated. Otherwise, the transaction/sequence is not executed. Default value is <span class="computer">false</span> for a standard access to transactions/sequences. <br/><span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> <br/><br/>• When a context is authenticated, all the contexts in the same HTTP session are also authenticated. For more information about context and HTTP session, see <i>Context general presentation</i> paragraph in <i>JavaScript Objects APIs</i> chapter. <br/>• When executing a transaction/sequence from stub (<span class="computer">__stub</span> variable passed to <span class="computer">true</span> in entry), this property is ignored. Indeed, executing from stub is for testing purposes and should not require any authentication: the context would never be authenticated as the transaction/sequence setting the context as authenticated could also be executed from stub.<br/>
Authenticated user as cache key | boolean | expert | Defines whether the authenticated user should be used as cache key.<br/>When the cache is enabled (<b>Response lifetime</b> setting filled with a time-to-live), the <b>Authenticated user as cache key</b> property allows to specify to use the authenticated user ID from context/session as an additional key to the cache. <br/>It would have as effect that two different identified users cannot retrieve the cached response of the other for the same request. Default value is <span class="computer">false</span>: the authenticated user is not used as cache key.
Auto-commit | int | expert | Defines the commit mode, to be automatic or not.<br/>The <b>Auto-commit</b> property can take one of the following values: <br/><br/>• <span class="computer">enabled, after each query</span>: auto-commit is done after executing each query from the <b>Query</b> property, <br/>• <span class="computer">enabled, once at the end</span>: auto-commit is done after executing all queries from the <b>Query</b> property, <br/>• <span class="computer">disabled, manual commit</span>: the developer should program himself the commits to the database thanks to <span class="computer">COMMIT</span> statement. <br/><br/>Default value is <span class="computer">enabled, after each query</span>, enabling auto-commit after each query execution. <br/><span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> <br/><br/>• Not all databases support "grouped transactions" and "rollback". To use this property, be sure that your target database supports these features. Otherwise, the auto-commit is always applied. <br/>
Call the biller | boolean | expert | Defines whether the billing management module should be called for each generated XML document.<br/>If this property is set to <span class="computer">true</span>, the applicable billing management module, defined thanks to the connector's billing class name property, is invoqued. <b>This parameter should never be changed</b> (Convertigo private use only).
Character set | String | expert | Defines the character set used for operations on the generated XML document (default: <span class="computer">UTF-8</span>).
Generate JSON type | boolean | expert | Add "type" attributes to respect JSON types for the .json requester.<br/>This property will add "type" and "originalKeyName" attributes on XML response. The <span class="computer">FLAT_ELEMENT</span> is the recommended mode, other modes will just add the array support for rows.
Include certificate group | boolean | expert | Includes the certificate group into the cache key.<br/>If set to <span class="computer">true</span>, the certificate group is added to the cache key which is used to determine whether the transaction's response should be pulled from the cache or not. <br/>A transaction's cached response is pulled from the cache when all cache key values are corresponding to a stored cache entry.
Optional max number of results | String | expert | Defines the maximum number of results returned by the SQL query.<br/>Setting this property automatically adds a <span class="computer">LIMIT xx</span> at the end of the query before its execution on the database. It allows limiting automatically the number of results of every execution of one query. <br/><span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> <br/><br/>• Beware that this property should be used only when the target SQL database allows the <span class="computer">LIMIT</span> keyword in the queries. To know which type of database is accessed by the transaction, refer to the <b>Driver</b> property of parent <i>SQL connector</i>. <br/>• Beware that this property cannot be used when the <b>Query</b> property contains several queries.<br/>
Output mode | int | expert | Defines how the resulting XML is generated from each SQL query result.<br/>The <b>Output mode</b> property allows to change the structure of generated XML for a same query result. It can be set to one of the following values: <br/><br/>• <span class="computer">RAW</span>: generates a <span class="computer">row</span> element for each result line, selected columns are added as attributes named after the column names. Note that as the columns are XML attributes, they are sorted by alphabetical order under the <span class="computer">row</span> element. <br/>• <span class="computer">AUTO</span>: generates a mix of complex elements and elements with attributes (interesting for multi-table requests). <br/>• <span class="computer">ELEMENT</span>: generates XML elements named after table names, selected columns are added as child XML elements named after column name. In case of multi-table requests, one row is a complex element which depth depends on the number of selected tables. Note that as the columns are XML elements, they are sorted in the order requested in the query and as the resultset has returned data. <br/>• <span class="computer">ELEMENT_WITH_ATTRIBUTES</span>: generates a structure similar to the <span class="computer">ELEMENT</span> output mode but with <span class="computer">row</span> and <span class="computer">column</span> tag names. Each element (row or column) contains a <span class="computer">name</span> attribute with the actual name of the selected table or column (useful when table or column names contain symbols not allowed in XML tag names, or start by a number, etc.). <br/>• <span class="computer">FLAT_ELEMENT</span>: generates a structure similar to the <span class="computer">RAW</span> output mode but with elements instead of attributes. Each result line generates a <span class="computer">row</span> element, selected columns are added as child XML elements named after the column names. Note that as the columns are XML elements, they are sorted in the order requested in the query and as the resultset has returned data.<br/>
Response client cache | boolean | expert | Defines whether the transaction/sequence response should be cached by the client.<br/>If set to <span class="computer">false</span>, the response XML is sent to the client along with HTTP headers forcing the client browser not to store it in its local cache. This is the default value, since dynamic responses are usually preferred. If set to <span class="computer">true</span>, the XML response is sent normally.
Response lifetime | String | expert | Defines the response time-to-live (in seconds) in cache, i.e. the time during which the cached response remains valid or time interval for its renewal.  This property enables the cache when filled, disables the cache when left empty.<br/>The <b>Response lifetime</b> property allows to specify the cache settings for the transaction/sequence's response. It can be set to the following values: <br/><br/>• <span class="computer">&lt;empty&gt;</span>: Disables the cache for the transaction/sequence. The response will not be cached and each request will execute the complete transaction. It is the default value. <br/>• <span class="computer">absolute,&lt;time in secs&gt;</span>: Enables the cache for the transaction/sequence. The response will be cached for the time specified in seconds. If an other request with the same parameters occurs within this time, the response will be returned from the cache. <br/>• <span class="computer">daily,hh:mm:ss</span>: Enables the cache for the transaction/sequence. The response will be cached until <span class="computer">hh:mm:ss</span> of the current day is reached. If an other request with the same parameters occurs before this time, the response will be returned from the cache. <b>A new day starts at 00:00:00.</b> <br/>• <span class="computer">weekly,hh:mm:ss,w</span>: Enables the cache for the transaction/sequence. The response will be cached until <span class="computer">hh:mm:ss</span> of the <span class="computer">wth</span> day of week is reached. For Sunday w = 1, for Monday w = 2 ... and for Saturday w = 7. If an other request with the same parameters occurs before this time, the response will be returned from the cache. <b>A new day starts at 00:00:00.</b> <br/>• <span class="computer">monthly,hh:mm:ss,d</span>: Enables the cache for the transaction/sequence. The response will be cached until <span class="computer">hh:mm:ss</span> of the <span class="computer">dth</span> day of month is reached. If an other request with the same parameters occurs before this time, the response will be returned from the cache. <b>A new day starts at 00:00:00.</b> <br/><br/><span class="orangetwinsoft">Notes:</span> <br/><br/>• The <b>Response lifetime</b> property editor proposes a <i>Generator tool</i> that can help you configure the <b>Response lifetime</b> setting. <br/>• The <i>Variable</i> objects contain the <b>Cache key</b> property that allows to specify to use this variable as a key to the cache or not. See <i>Variable</i> objects documentation for more information. <br/>
Secure connection required | boolean | expert | Defines whether the transaction/sequence should be called through a secured connection (e.g. HTTPS).<br/>Depending on the requester, if this property is set to <span class="computer">true</span>, the transaction/sequence must be accessed through a secure connection (e.g. HTTPS in case of HTTP access). Default value is <span class="computer">false</span> for a standard access to transactions/sequences.
Style sheet | int | expert | Defines how the XML returned by the transaction has to be processed by XSLT.<br/>This property can take the following values:<br/><br/>• <span class="computer">None</span>: Do not process with XSLT. Usual setting for web services (SOAP or REST) where plain XML data is to be returned.<br/>• <span class="computer">From transaction</span>: Use the XSL style sheet attached to the transaction. When used, make sure a style sheet object is added to the transaction.<br/>• <span class="computer">From last detected screen class</span>: Use XSL style sheet attached to the last detected screen class (in case of a transaction with screen classes). <br/><br/>Transactions using sheets from last detected screen class are mainly used in Web Clipping or Legacy Publishing projects.
XML grouping | boolean | expert | Defines whether the resulting XML should be grouped by elements.<br/>Default value is <span class="computer">false</span>. Setting it to <span class="computer">true</span> enables the grouping of XML elements in the transaction's XML response. The behavior can be different depending on the <b>Output mode</b> property value.
