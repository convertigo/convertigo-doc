##### Creates a complex mouse action on an element or a position of the web page. 

This statement allows to trigger complex mouse events, provided that attributes of the accessed DOM element manage such events. <br/>Supported mouse events, defined in the <b>Action</b> property, are the following:<br/><br/>• <span class="computer">click</span>: simulates a mouse <span class="computer">click</span> event, <br/>• <span class="computer">mousedown</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">mousedown</span> event (first part of a mouse click event, when mouse button is clicked), <br/>• <span class="computer">mouseup</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">mouseup</span> event (second part of a mouse click event, when mouse button is released), <br/>• <span class="computer">mouseover</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">mouseover</span> event (mouse is moved onto an element), <br/>• <span class="computer">mouseout</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">mouseout</span> event (mouse is moved out of an element), <br/>• <span class="computer">mousemove</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">mousemove</span> event (mouse is moved anywhere), <br/>• <span class="computer">mousedrag</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">mousedrag</span> event (mouse drags an object), <br/>• <span class="computer">dblclick</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">dblclick</span> event (mouse double-clicks an object), <br/>• <span class="computer">dragdrop</span>: simulates a <span class="computer">dragdrop</span> event (mouse drags and drops an object).<br/><br/>The XPath defined in <b>XPath</b> property is applied on the web page to retrieve the element on which the event has to be performed. If the <b>XPath</b> property is empty, the mouse position can be used to find an element on which perform the event. <br/>The mouse position can be defined using the <b>Client X</b> and the <b>Client Y</b> properties or the <b>Screen X</b> and the <b>Screen Y</b> properties. <br/><span class="orangetwinsoft">Note:</span> For simple actions, prefer to use the <i>Mouse action</i> statement.

Property | Type | Category | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Action | String | standard | Defines the JavaScript action corresponding to the event to perform.<br/>Depending of the statement, this property can take several values. These values are indicated in the object's description.
Button | JS expression | standard | Defines which mouse button is used during the mouse event.<br/>Some mouse events are triggered by the depression or release of a mouse button. This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution and indicates which mouse button is used during this state change.<br/>This property can take the following values: <br/><br/>• <span class="computer">zero</span>: left button,<br/>• <span class="computer">one</span>: middle button, if applicable,<br/>• <span class="computer">two</span>: right button.<br/><br/>For mouse devices configured for left-handed use, in which button actions are reversed, values are reversed too (from right to left).
Client X | JS expression | standard | Defines the client (web browser) relative <span class="computer">X</span> coordinate (in pixels).<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution and gives the horizontal coordinate, relatively to the top left corner of the DOM layout, at which the event should occur.
Client Y | JS expression | standard | Defines the client (web browser) relative <span class="computer">Y</span> coordinate (in pixels).<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution and gives the vertical coordinate, relatively to the top left corner of the DOM layout, at which the event should occur.
Comment | String | standard | Describes the object comment to include in the documentation report.<br/>This property generally contains an explanation about the object.
Delay if XPath not found | long | standard | Defines the maximum delay the statement waits if the XPath doesn't currently exists.<br/>When no node in the page DOM matches the XPath defined in <b>XPath</b> property, the statement waits for it to match up to this delay, set in milliseconds. <br/>Convertigo tries to evaluate the specified XPath while receiving a web page or executing JavaScript in it. Once the XPath matches at least one node of the page, the statement continues its action. <br/>Note: It is equivalent to defining a statement <i>Wait synchronization</i> with an <span class="computer">XPath</span> synchronizer before this statement, waiting for the same XPath.
Is active | boolean | standard | Defines whether the statement is active.
Press alt key | JS expression | standard | Defines whether the "<span class="computer">alt</span>" key is to be depressed when firing the event.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution as a boolean defining if the <span class="computer">alt</span> key should be depressed when firing the event. <br/>On some platforms, the <span class="computer">alt</span> key may map to an alternative key name.
Press ctrl key | JS expression | standard | Defines whether the "<span class="computer">ctrl</span>" key is to be depressed when firing the event.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution as a boolean defining if the <span class="computer">ctrl</span> key should be depressed when firing the event. <br/>On some platforms, the <span class="computer">ctrl</span> key may map to an alternative key name.
Press meta key | JS expression | standard | Defines whether the "<span class="computer">meta</span>" key is to be depressed when firing the event.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution as a boolean defining if the <span class="computer">meta</span> key should be depressed when firing the event. <br/>On some platforms, the <span class="computer">meta</span> key may map to an alternative key name.
Press shift key | JS expression | standard | Defines whether the "<span class="computer">shift</span>" key is to be depressed when firing the event.<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution as a boolean defining if the <span class="computer">shift</span> key should be depressed when firing the event. <br/>On some platforms, the <span class="computer">shift</span> key may map to an alternative key name.
Screen X | JS expression | standard | Defines the absolute screen <span class="computer">X</span> coordinate (in pixels).<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution and gives the horizontal coordinate, relatively to the top left corner of the screen, at which the event should occur.
Screen Y | JS expression | standard | Defines the absolute screen <span class="computer">Y</span> coordinate (in pixels).<br/>This property is a JavaScript expression that is evaluated during the transaction execution and gives the vertical coordinate, relatively to the top left corner of the screen, at which the event should occur.
XPath | JS expression | standard | Defines the XPath expression of elements on which the statement applies.<br/>Depending on the statement, the execution of this <b>XPath</b> on the web page DOM can result in a single <span class="computer">Node</span> or a <span class="computer">NodeList</span>.
Synchronization | TriggerXMLizer | expert | Defines how to synchronize the statement.<br/>A synchronizer states how and when accessed pages are considered fully loaded. Only then are data extracted and new pages re-detected.<br/>There are several types of synchronizers, that are described hereafter:<br/><br/>• <span class="computer">Document completed</span>: The synchronizer waits for a number of documents to be completed. Specify here how many "document completed" events Convertigo has to wait for before assuming that the page is complete. In many cases, when the target application uses HTTP META redirects or JavaScript redirects, the document is loaded several times. You can monitor <br/><span class="computer">==== start parse ======</span><br/>and<br/><span class="computer">==== Parse end ==(XXXms )====================</span><br/>traces in the Engine console (debug mode) to count the number of "document completed" events needed for the synchronizer. The <span class="computer">Document completed</span> synchronizer can be configured to also stop on alert messages that could pop up. Alert messages do not trigger a "document completed" event and are not detected by this synchronizer. To activate this option, check the <b>Stop on alert</b> checkbox. <br/>• <span class="computer">XPath</span>: The synchronizer waits until a specified XPath is found. Convertigo tries to evaluate the specified XPath while receiving a web page or executing JavaScript in it. Once the XPath matches at least one node of the page, the synchronizer returns. <br/>• <span class="computer">Wait time</span>: The synchronizer waits until a specified time is reached (in ms, set via the <b>Timeout</b> property). <br/>• <span class="computer">Screen Class</span>: The synchronizer waits for one of the selected screen classes to be detected. Several screen classes can be selected to be waited for. The synchronizer returns when one of them is reached. <br/>• <span class="computer">Download started</span>: The synchronizer waits for a download request. This is the perfect synchronizer to use before a <b>Get attachment</b> statement. <br/>• <span class="computer">No wait</span>: The synchronizer doesn't wait and execution proceeds directly. <br/><br/>For all synchronizer types, the maximum waiting time is set using the <b>Timeout</b> property.
