Convertigo Platform enables collaborative development and DevOps operations using Continuous Integration techniques. DevOps is usually a set of tasks that can be described this way :

* __Coding__ : code development and review, source code management tools, code merging.
  
  Convertigo enables coding using Low Code technologies. You can have more information on collaborative development & source control / code merging [here](#collaborative_development).
* __Building__ : continuous integration tools, build status.

  On Convertigo platform building can be made manually or using Continuous integration tools. More information on this [here](#integrating_in_ci).
* __Testing__ : continuous testing tools that provide quick and timely feedback on business risks
* __Packaging__ : artifact repository, application pre-deployment staging. 
  
  On Convertigo platform application packaging is done using the .CAR (Convertigo ARchive) format. This can be done manually by simply exporting a project from studio , or using Continuous Integration. see [here](#integrating_in_ci).
* __Releasing__ : change management, release approvals, release automation.

    On Convertigo platform, release is simply done by deploying projects on a Convertigo server. This can be done manually using the studio's deploy menu or by using Continuous Integration as described [here](#integrating_in_ci).
* __Configuring__ : infrastructure configuration and management, infrastructure as code tools.

    On Convertigo platform, configuration and environment settings is done via the Administration console. More information on this [here](../../operating-guide/using-convertigo-administration-console).

* __Monitoring__ : applications performance monitoring, end-user experience

    On Convertigo platform, performance monitoring is done via the Administration console. More information on this [here](../../operating-guide/using-convertigo-administration-console).
