## Convertigo software elements

This section briefly presents Convertigo software elements:

### Convertigo Studio

Convertigo Studio is the application development tool. It allows the developpers to develop Convertigo projects, including the creation and configuration of objects such as transactions, extraction rules, sequences, etc.

The Studio saves Convertigo projectsâ€™ specific data into XML files, which will be deployed and used by the Convertigo Server.

For more information on Convertigo Studio installation process and supported platforms, see [Installing Convertigo Studio](../installing-convertigo-studio/).

### Convertigo Server

Convertigo Server executes projects created in Convertigo Studio. The Server can manage simultaneous users connected and requesting data for all different types of connectors (Legacy, HTML, Web service, SQL, etc.).

Convertigo Server is:

- a standalone server program installed as a service for Windows platforms, or
- a standard Web application for all other operating systems.

For more information on Convertigo Server installation process, as well as supported platforms and web application servers, see [Installing Convertigo Server](../installing-convertigo-server/).

Convertigo Server engine can be monitored using the web Administration Console.

### Administration Console

Administration Console is the web application that is used to administrate and configure the Convertigo Studio or Convertigo Server engine.

Thanks to a left menu leading to several pages, Convertigo Studio developers or Convertigo Server administrators can monitor engine activity and configure many engine settings.

For more information on the Administration Console, see [Using Convertigo Administration Console](../using-convertigo-administration-console/)
