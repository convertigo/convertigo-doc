You have to finish the installation by configuring it at startup. This section presents the procedures to finish installing and configuring Convertigo Studio on all platforms.

- [Configure Convertigo Studio at first startup](#configure-convertigo-studio-at-first-startup)

### Convertigo Studio default configuration

#### Configure Convertigo studio at first startup

Common to all platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS), the following procedure describes how to finish installing and configuring Convertigo Studio at first start.

##### To start and configure Convertigo Studio on Windows/Linux/Mac OS

**1**. On Windows, if you choose to create shortcuts during the installation wizard, simply access the shorcut that is on your desktop and double-click on it to launch Convertigo Studio. Otherwise, use the Start menu to launch Convertigo Studio.

For other platforms, Convertigo Studio was installed in the folder you choose during installation procedure. You can open this folder to access the *ConvertigoStudio* start file and double-click on it to launch Convertigo Studio.

Convertigo Studio starts:

{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_1.PNG" caption="Figure 2 - 10: Convertigo Studio splashscreen at startup" %}

When Convertigo Studio opens, the Workspace Launcher popup is displayed:

{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_2.jpg" caption="Figure 2 - 11: Workspace launcher" %}

**2**. In this screen, indicate the location of your projects workspace, set by default to your user environment. 

{{site.data.alerts.note}}
For more information on Convertigo workspace and projects workspace, <a href="../appendixes/#convertigo-workspace">see Appendix Convertigo workspace</a>.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{{site.data.alerts.important}}
Beware that you must choose a folder where you have writing rights. Otherwise, you will not be able to restart the Studio on this same workspace.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

**3**. Check the **Use this as default and do not ask again** checkbox if you do not want to see the Workspace Launcher popup at next startup:

{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_3.jpg" caption="Figure 2 - 12: Updated values in Workspace Launcher" %}

**4**. Click on the **OK** button.

The Studio starts and a wizard is opened:

{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_4.PNG" caption="Figure 2 - 13: First Studio start - Starting wizard" %}

This is the **Convertigo Studio Configuration** wizard. You have to go through this wizard before the Studio engine starts.

For Windows environment, continue with step 6 of this procedure.

For Linux and Mac OS environments, the first page of the wizard is the End User Licence Agreement. You need to carefully read the EULA and accept it before the Studio starts:

{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_5.jpg" caption="Figure 2 - 14: First Studio start - EULA on Linux or Mac" %}

**5**. Select the **Accept license** option, and click on **Next**.

**6**. The next page displays a summary about the workspace (workspace that was chosen in the Workspace Launcher window). Depending on the selected path:

- if the selected folder does not exist or is empty: a new workspace will be created
- if the selected folder is a previous Convertigo workspace created with a Convertigo prior to version 6.2.0: the workspace will be migrated,
- if the selected folder is a previous Convertigo workspace created with a Convertigo from version 6.2.0: the workspace will be used as is. In this case, several pages of the wizard may not be displayed because the workspace is reused.

{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_6.PNG" caption="Figure 2 - 15: Studio starting wizard - Convertigo workspace" %}

**7**. If the summary does not fit your needs, click on **Cancel** and restart this procedure from step 1.

**8**. Otherwise, click on **Next**.

The next page allows you to configure a proxy for Convertigo Studio to access the Internet:

{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_7.PNG" caption="Figure 2 - 16: Studio starting wizard - Proxy settings" %}

**9**. If you need to use a proxy, configure your proxy settings in this page.
 
{{site.data.alerts.note}}
For more information about Convertigo proxy settings, <a href="../using-convertigo-administration-console/#proxy">see Proxy</a>. This page explains the Convertigo Engine configuration properties about proxy. Settings found in this wizard page are the same.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

**10**. You can test the connection by clicking on the **Check connection** button. A message indicates that the connection test is in progress:

{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_8.PNG" caption="Figure 2 - 17: Studio starting wizard - Testing connection" %}

After the test is finished, a message is displayed indicating whether the connection is successful or not:

{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_9.PNG" caption="Figure 2 - 18: Studio starting wizard - Successful connection test" %}

**11**. If the connection is not successful, configure correctly your proxy settings (start over from step 9 of this procedure).

**12**. Otherwise, click on *Next*.

The next page asks if you already have a Personal Studio Configuration.
 
{{site.data.alerts.note}}
A Personal Studio Configuration is an encrypted string that will automatically configure your Convertigo Studio with projects deployment configurations.
By registrating on this wizard, you will be granted a free access to Convertigo Trial Cloud and will get a PSC with a default deployment configuration to this shared Cloud server.
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_10.PNG" caption="Figure 2 - 19: Studio starting wizard - Personal Studio Configuration" %}

On this page, several options are possible:

#### Case of an already registered Studio user

If you were already registered in a former version of Convertigo and you already had a registration certificate for deploying your projects on Convertigo Trial Cloud (see Figure 2 - 20), or if you already got a Personal Studio Configuration by registering in Convertigo 6.2.x or 6.3.x (see Figure 2 - 28), you do not need to register again.

{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_11.jpg" caption="Figure 2 - 20: Example of former registration certificate email" %}

Continue with the procedure [To configure Convertigo Studio with a PSC or a registration key](#to-configure-convertigo-studio-with-a-psc-or-a-registration-key).

#### Case of a new Convertigo Studio testing user, you have to register now

You do not have a registration key nor a PSC, you have to register in the **Studio Configuration** wizard to get one. Thanks to that, you will be granted:

- a free access to Convertigo Trial Cloud
- an account in the Convertigo Forum to get some tips and tricks
- and a free 20 minutes "Getting Started" web meeting session

Continue with the procedure “To register on Convertigo Trial Cloud”

##### To configure Convertigo Studio with a PSC or a registration key

**1**. In the Personal Studio Configuration page of the **Studio Configuration** wizard (see Figure 2 - 19), select the **I already have a PSC** option, and click on **Next**.

The next page proposes a text area into which you should paste your PSC or your former registration certificate (received by email):
{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_20.PNG" caption="Figure 2 - 29: Studio starting wizard - Personal Studio Configuration" %}

**2**. In the **PSC** text area, copy and paste your former registration certificate or your Personal Studio Configuration:
{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_21.PNG" caption="Figure 2 - 30: Studio starting wizard - Filling in your PSC" %}

If the PSC or the registration certificate is not valid, the wizard indicates an error message:
{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_22.PNG" caption="Figure 2 - 31: Studio starting wizard - Invalid PSC" %}

**3**. Otherwise, the **Next** button is enabled, click on this button to continue.
A **Setup summary** page is displayed, it shows all steps that are going to be performed at finish:

{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_23.PNG" caption="Figure 2 - 32: Studio starting wizard - Setup summary" %}

**4**. Click on the **Finish** button if all the configurations displayed on this page are correct. Otherwise, click on **Cancel** and restart the procedure [To start and configure Convertigo Studio on Windows/Linux/Mac OS](#to-start-and-configure-convertigo-studio-on-windowslinuxmac-os), from step 1.

After the wizard is complete, The Studio engine starts.

Sometimes, on Windows environments, a Windows Security Alert popup is displayed:

{% include image.html file="guide_img/c8ostudio_24.PNG" caption="Figure 2 - 33: Windows Security Alert popup" %}

**5**. In this window, you have to select the type of network you are connected to, this will authorize Convertigo to access the network and the several projects’ target applications. Check the appropriate checkbox and click on the **Allow access** button.

While the Convertigo engine is starting, a **Convertigo News** popup is displayed. It shows our latest news (a link for you to access our Facebook page and a list of our latest tweets):
